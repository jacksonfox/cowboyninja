1. [Portland, OR](http://noms.in/portland)
2. [Charleston, SC](http://www.theawl.com/2011/05/the-best-fried-chicken-in-the-world-galaxy-universe)
3. [New Orleans, LA](http://noms.in/neworleans)

**Note:** Technically, I've been to New Orleans several times, but my list of places to try still has a few dozen items on it.
