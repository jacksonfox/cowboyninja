title: Five Things I Love/Hate About Baton Rouge

## Things I Love

* **Burgersmith:** Fantastic burgers, fries, and fried okra. Serves up a great selection of local beers to wash it all down.
* **Lakeside Drive:** Most of it's been taken over by runners, walkers, and cyclists. One of the rare spots in the city where you can feel safe doing all three. Add in gorgeous sunsets, and roosting herons, ibis, and egrets.
* **Fall &amp; Spring:** The summer heat is gone, the humidity has been tamed, and you can finally enjoy being outside. Thankfully, there are a million festivals to enjoy while you're out.

## Things I Hate

* **Traffic:** The [worst in the nation](http://www.lsureveille.com/news/study-ranks-baton-rouge-traffic-worst-1.2447596#.TtkzwErNr0g) for cities with 500,000-1,000,000 people.
* **Summer:** It's hot. It's humid. You don't want to go outside. Thankfully, Spring & Fall do their best to make up for it.
