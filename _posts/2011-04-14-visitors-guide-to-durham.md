Erica and I spent 8 years in Durham, arriving just after college and leaving after Erica had finished her PhD at Duke. In that time we fell in love with Durham (and North Carolina). I'd like to share some of things we loved about Durham, in case you ever find yourself there (and I hope you do).

## Southern Durham

It might not be as cool as downtown (what with the giant mall and everything) but this was our neighborhood, and there are a few things you shouldn't miss.

* First, kick back with a beer and some chili-braised chicken nachos at City Beverage. Fantastic food, and an amazing beer list. Our favorite neighborhood restaurant.

* If you're looking for something quicker, grab a great fast-food burger at Char-Grill. The Triangle has two local burger chains. Char-Grill's burgers win hands down, but the shake menu at Cook-Out is worth a look.

* If you're looking to spend a nice afternoon, ride your bike down the American Tobacco Trail, it'll drop you off right in downtown.

## MLK & University Dr.

Alright, so MLK Pkwy. and University Dr. aren't the most scenic parts of town, but they've got more than their fair share of great food. 

* Grab a burger from Only Burger. Originally a food truck-only operation, they recently opened a retail outlet as well. The fried green tomato breakfast burger is amazing.

* Local Yogurt beat the recent frozen yogurt renaissance by a few months, and beats out any of the new chains with their actually-tastes-like-yogurt frozen yogurt. The plain in particular is nicely tart.

* The Q-Shack may not be authentic NC 'cue (actually, that's something Durham lacks), but it's pretty good regardless. I'm partial to the ribs and pulled pork, but make sure to get hushpuppies and eat out on the picnic benches.

* If you need a place to enjoy a nice spring morning, grab brunch at Guglhupf. Or if it's too cold to sit outside, come back later for lunch or dinner. The food has a German flair, the pastries are always fantastic, and the space is gorgeous. The only problem is that everyone knows it and getting a table can be tricky. Try to get there before 10 AM for brunch on Sunday.

## Ninth Street

Just east of Duke's main campus is the slightly shabby area around Ninth St. This was the first part of town we got to know after moving to Durham. While I'm sad that a few favorite places have closed (like 9th St. Books), overall it's still a great place to find good food for cheap.

* Get tacos or a burrito at Chubby's, and make sure to try the guacatillo salsa. Chubby's has spread all over the Triangle, but this was where it all started not that long ago.

* Speaking of burritos, you have to stop by Cosmic Cantina for a burrito before you leave Durham. Great fresh salsa, tasty chicken, and every single burrito is precision engineered. No busted tortillas here. The atmosphere is scuzzy, but the food is tasty.

* If beer, a burger, and some tater tots are more your speed, check out Dain's Place.

* The Regulator is one of the last independent book stores in the area, and continues to be the choice destination for visiting authors.

* If you head a little ways down Hillsborough St, you can grab a popsicle or ice cream at local sensation LocoPops. Featuring flavors like mango chile and (may favorite) spearmint lemonade, LocoPops are not to be missed.

* Looking for something a bit more upscale? Magnolia Grill has James Beard-award-winning southern cuisine, and owners/chefs Karen and Ben Barker have [helped an amazing number of local chefs start their careers](http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/04/28/456362/from-two-chefs-many.html).

## Broad Street

Just past Ninth St., sitting next to Duke's east campus, is Broad St.

* The Piedmont is on the forefront of the local food movement, with farm-to-table restaurants like Amy Tornquist’s Watt's Grocery leading the way. The food is awesome, but the brunch (if you can get in) is even better.

* Watt’s Grocery features coffee from local roaster Joe Van Gogh, who happens to be just a few doors down from the restaurant. Joe’s was one of my favorite places to work away from the office.

## Downtown

Downtown Durham has 

* Get a sandwich at Toast
* A pastry from Scratch Bakery
* Coffee from Beyu
* Blueberry muffin or some beignets from Rue Cler
* Tacos at Dos Perros
* Spend a beautiful spring evening watching the Durham Bulls with a BBQ sandwich and custard from Goodberry's.  
* Meetup with the cool kids at Pinhook after work on Friday
* Dinner at the Federal
* Hang out at Fullsteam til late

## Other Spots

* Go for a hike at Umstead State Park
* Walk through the Sarah P. Duke gardens
* Check out the campus of UNC, stop by the Old Well, then cruise down Franklin St.
* Go to the beach! Wilmington for the day, or the Outer Banks for a longer stay.
* Grab some super-juicy peruvian chicken at Mami Nora's, or head around the corner to any one of several authentic taquerias along Roxboro.
* In the spring, you can check out the live music and crafts at the Eno River Festival. Any other time of the year you the parks along the Eno provide great spots for picnics, hiking, or playing in the water. Make sure to find someone to give you directions to the quarry.
* Ice cream at Mapleview Farm
