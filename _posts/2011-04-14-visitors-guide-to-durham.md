title: A Visitor's Guide to Durham
---
This is an in-progress guide to my favorite spots in Durham, NC.

## Southern Durham
* Kick back with a beer and some chili-braised chicken nachos at City Beverage. Or a great fast-food burger at Char-Grill.
* Ride your bike down the American Tobacco Trail, it'll drop you off right in downtown.

## Ninth Street
* Get tacos at Chubby's, falafel from International Delights, a beer and burger from Dain's Place, a burrito from Cosmic Cantina, or sample some of the best food in the south at Magnolia Grill. Get coffee at Bean Traders, and check out a local author at The Regulator.
* Head a little ways down Hillsborough to grab a popsicle or ice cream at LocoPops.

## Broad Street

* Check out the used books at Nice Price, then head down to grab coffee at Joe Van Gogh, a beer and pizza from Broad St. Cafe, and some amazing farm-to-table fare at Watt's Grocery.

## Downtown
* Get a sandwich at Toast, a pastry from Scratch Bakery, coffee from Beyu, and a blueberry muffin or some beignets from Rue Cler. There are tacos at Dos Perros, and Cuban food La Havana.
* Spend a beautiful spring evening watching the Durham Bulls with a BBQ sandwich and custard from Goodberry's.  

## Other Spots
* Grab some super-juicy peruvian chicken at Mami Nora's, or head around the corner to any one of several authentic taquerias along Roxboro.
* In the spring, you can check out the live music and crafts at the Eno River Festival. Any other time of the year you the parks along the Eno provide great spots for picnics, hiking, or playing in the water. Make sure to find someone to give you directions to the quarry.
